I wrote this script a few years to avoid paying for no-ip service to keep track of my home network's external IP address. It has been clean up a little and anyone is free to use it if it solves some problem they need solving.

Make sure you have ssmtp correctly configured for sending out emails. I use a gmail account to forward emails from my computers.

Change the address's under Configuration in the script and add it to cron job on your system and you should be good to go.
